# schaat  
***a.k.a. why is this actually working?***

A random stranger chat app built with **React + Firebase**  
Inspired by boredom, curiosity, and *“what if this actually connects people?”*

>  **Warning:** You might end up talking to yourself if no one else is online

## What is this?

**schaat** is a real-time anonymous chat app where:

- You click **Find Stranger**
- You get connected to a **random human** *(hopefully)*
- You can **chat** or  **skip**
No signup forms.  
No emails.  

---

## Tech Stack

2. Firebase does its thing
3. You get matched with someone random
4. Start chatting
5. Skip anytime, repeat forever
